# Origin of this code
This code was found on http://francois-piette.blogspot.com/2013/04/inter-process-communication-using-pipes.html.

##Changes
I changed the directory structure of the code, so it is more obvious where to look for certain types of files.

##Licensing
On his home page Russel stated:

    All are welcome, and everything is free...
	
See https://web.archive.org/web/20100217071614/http://home.roadrunner.com/~rllibby/index.html
So I can only assume that he wanted his code to be in the public domain.
I assume something similar for for Francois-Piette's code.
